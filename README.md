# MERN_DevConnector

Welcome to "MERN Stack Front To Back". In this course we will build an in depth full stack social network application using Node.js, Express, React, Redux and MongoDB along with ES6+. We will start with a blank text editor and end with a deployed full stack application. This course includes...

Building an extensive backend API with Node.js & Express

Protecting routes/endpoints with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Extensive API testing with Postman

Integrating React with our backend in an elegant way, creating a great workflow

Building our frontend to work with the API

Using Redux for app state management

Creating reducers and actions for our resources

Creating many container components that integrate with Redux

Testing with the Redux Chrome extension

Creating a build script, securing our keys and deploy to Heroku using Git



UPDATE: The entire course was updated to use React Hooks, Async/Await and better overall code.

 

This is NOT an "Intro to React" or "Intro to Node" course. It is a practical hands on course for building an app using the incredible MERN stack. I do try and explain everything as I go so it is possible to follow without React/Node experience but it is recommended that you know at least the basics first.
